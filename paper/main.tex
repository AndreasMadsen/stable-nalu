\title{Neural Arithmetic Units}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

\begin{abstract}
%What’s the domain?
Arithmetic presents unique challenges to machine learning models as they are solved by inferring rules and axioms as opposed to interpolation of data.
%What’s the issue?
Neural networks has, with millions and sometimes billions of parameters, an ability to internalize incredible complex functions.
However, when extrapolating to out-of-distribution examples they often fail as the neural network learns an approximation and not the underlying logic.
%What’s your contribution?
We propose a plug-and-play module for neural networks that trains with stochastic gradient descent and can learn the of addition, subtraction and multiplication.
Our proposed Neural Addition Unit (NAU) and Neural Multiplication Unit (NMU) rely on weight constraints to learn rules and extrapolate well beyond current solutions.
%Why is it novel?
%What’s interesting about it?
The proposed NAU and NMU are inspired by the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU).
We find that replacing the nonlinearities in the weight matrix with a clipped linear function and adding an identity function to the log-exp multiplication unit is crucial for converging consistently.
%How does it perform?
Through analytic and empirical analysis we justify how the NAU and NMU improve the Neural Arithmetic Logic Unit (NALU) and standard multi-layer perceptron (MLP) models.
Our empirical results are fewer parameters, more consistent convergence, faster learning and more meaningful discrete values than the NALU.\footnote{In the interrest of scientific integrity, we have made the code for all experiments, and more, available on GitHub: \censor{\url{https://github.com/AndreasMadsen/stable-nalu}}. }
