\section{Conclusion}

% Far better sucess-rate, learns faster, have discrete weights.
% NAC-mul, converges only 13% of the time on a very simple problem. Our NMU converges 94% of the time.
% We tested on a range of different dataset configurations and shown that this is generally the case.

% NMU, understands negative inputs and thus can extrapolate into that domain.
% NAU, produces discrete weights unlike NAC.

% The models are theoretically inspired.

% MNIST findings?
