\section{Arithmetic task}

Our ``arithmetic task'' is identical to the ``simple function task'' in the NALU paper \cite{trask-nalu}. However, as they do not describe their dataset generation, dataset parameters, and model evaluation in details we elaborate on that here.

The aim of the ``Arithmetic task'' is to directly test arithmetic models ability to extrapolate beyond the training range. Additionally, our generalized version provides a high degree of flexibility in how the input is shaped, sampled, and the problem complexity.

\subsection{Dataset generation}
\label{sec:appendix:simple-function-task:data-generation}

The goal is to sum two random subsets of a vector $\mathbf{x}$ ($a$ and $b$), and perform an arithmetic operation on these ($a \circ b$).

\begin{equation}
    a = \sum_{i=s_{1,\mathrm{start}}}^{s_{1,\mathrm{end}}} x_i, \quad b = \sum_{i=s_{2,\mathrm{start}}}^{s_{2,\mathrm{end}}} x_i, \quad t = a \circ b
\end{equation}

Algorithm \ref{alg:simple-function-task-generator} defines the exact procedure to generate the data, where an interpolation range will be used for training and validation and an extrapolation range will be used for testing. Default values are defined in table \ref{tab:simple-function-task-defaults}.

\subsection{Model defintions and setup}

Models are defined in table \ref{tab:simple-function-task-model-defintions} and are all optimized with Adam optimization \cite{adam-optimization} using default parameters, and trained over $5 \cdot 10^6$ iterations. Training takes about 8 hours on a single CPU core(\text{8-Core Intel Xeon E5-2665 2.4GHz}). We run 19150 experiments on a HPC cluster.

The training dataset is continuously sampled from the interpolation range where a different seed is used for each experiment, all experiments use a mini-batch size of 128 observations, a fixed validation dataset with $1 \cdot 10^4$ observations sampled from the interpolation range, and a fixed test dataset with $1 \cdot 10^4$ observations sampled from the extrapolation range.

\subsection{Ablation study}
\label{sec:appendix:ablation-study}
To validate our model, we perform an ablation on the multiplication problem. Some noteworthy observations:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item None of the $W$ constraints, such as $\mathcal{R}_{sparse}$ and clamping W to be in $[0, 1]$, are necessary when the hidden size is just $2$.
    \item Removing the $\mathcal{R}_{sparse}$ causes the NMU to immediately fail for larger hidden sizes.
    \item Removing the clamping of W does not cause much difference. This is because $\mathcal{R}_{sparse}$ also constrains $W$ outside of $[0, 1]$. The regularizer used here is $\mathcal{R}_{sparse} = \min(|W|, |1 - W|)$, which is identical to the one used in other experiments in $[0, 1]$, but is also valid outside $[0, 1]$. Doing this gives only a slightly slower convergence. Although, this can not be guaranteed in general, as the regularizer is omitted during the initial optimization.
    \item Removing both constraints, gives a somewhat satisfying solution, but with a lower success-rate, slower convergence, and higher sparsity error.
\end{enumerate}

In conclusion both constraints are valuable, as they provide faster convergence and a sparser solution, but they are not critical to the success-rate of the NMU.

\subsection{Effect of dataset parameter}
\label{sec:appendix-simple-function-task:dataset-parameter-effect}

To stress test the models on the multiplication task, we vary the dataset parameters one at a time while keeping the others at their default value (default values in table \ref{tab:simple-function-task-defaults}). Each runs for 50 experiments with different seeds. The results, are visualized in figure \ref{fig:simple-function-static-dataset-parameters-boundary}.

In figure \ref{fig:simple-function-static-theoreical-claims-experiment}, the inperpolation-range is changed, therefore the the extrapolation-range needs to be changed such it doesn't overlap. For each interpolation-range the following extrapolation-range is used: ${\mathrm{U}[-2,-1] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[-6,-2]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[-2,2] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[-6,-2] \cup \mathrm{U}[2,6]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[0,1] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[1,5]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[0.1,0.2] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[0.2,2]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[1.1,1.2] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[1.2,6]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[1,2] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[2,6]}$, ${\mathrm{U}[10, 20] \text{ uses } \mathrm{U}[20, 40]}$.

\subsection{Gating convergence experiment}
\label{sec:appendix:nalu-gate-experiment}

In the interest of adding some understand of what goes wrong in the NALU gate, and the shared weight choice that NALU employs to fix this, we introduce the following experiment.

We train two models to fit the arithmetic task. Both uses the $\mathrm{NAC}_{+}$ in the first layer and NALU in the second layer. The only difference is that one model shares the weight between $\mathrm{NAC}_{+}$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ in the NALU, and the other just treat them as two separate models with separate weights. In both cases NALU should gate between $\mathrm{NAC}_{+}$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ and choose the appropriate operation. Note that this NALU model is different from the one presented elsewhere in this paper, including the original NALU paper \cite{trask-nalu}. The typical NALU model is just two NALU layers with shared weights.

Furthermore, we also introduce a new gated unit that simply gates between our proposed NMU and NAU, using the same sigmoid gating-mechanism in NALU. This also used seperate weights, as NMU and NAU uses different weight constrains and can therefore not be shared.

The models are trained for 100 different seeds, on the multiplication and addition task. A histogram of the gate-value is presented in figure \ref{fig:simple-function-static-nalu-gate-graph} and table \ref{tab:simple-function-static-nalu-gate-table} contains a summary. Some noteworthy observations:

\vspace{-0.3cm}\begin{enumerate}
    \item When the NALU weights are separated, far more trials converge to select $\mathrm{NAC}_{+}$, for both the addition and multiplication task. Sharing the weights between $\mathrm{NAC}_{+}$ and $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$, makes it less likely for addition to be selected. 
    \item The performance of the addition task is dependent on NALU selecting the right operation. In the multiplication task, when the right gate is selected, $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ do not converge consistently, unlike our NMU that converges more consistently.
    \item Which gate is selected appears to be mostly random and independent of the task. This issues caused by the sigmoid gating-mechanism and thus exists independent of the used sub-units.
\end{enumerate}

These observations validates that the NALU gating-mechanism does not converge as intended. This becomes a critical issues when more gates are present, as is normally the case.

\subsection{Regularization}
\label{sec:appendix:simple-function-task:regualization}

The $\lambda_{start}$ and $\lambda_{end}$ are simply selected based on how much time it takes for the model to converge. The sparsity regularizer should not be used during early optimization, as this part of the optimization is simply about getting each weight on the right side of $\pm 0.5$.

In figure \ref{fig:simple-fnction-static-regularizer-add}, \ref{fig:simple-fnction-static-regularizer-sub}, and \ref{fig:simple-fnction-static-regularizer-mul} the scaling factor $\hat{\lambda}_{\mathrm{sparse}}$ is optimized.
\begin{equation}
\lambda_{\mathrm{sparse}} = \hat{\lambda}_{\mathrm{sparse}} \max(\min(\frac{t - \lambda_{\mathrm{start}}}{\lambda_{\mathrm{end}} - \lambda_{\mathrm{start}}}, 1), 0)
\end{equation}

\subsection{Comparing all models}
\label{sec:appendix:comparison-all-models}

Table \ref{tab:function-task-static-defaults-all} compares all models on all operations used in NALU \cite{trask-nalu}. All variations of model and operation, are trained for 100 different seeds. Some noteworthy observations are:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Division does not work for any model, including the $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ and NALU models. This may seem surprising but is actually in line with the results from the NALU paper (\citet{trask-nalu}, table 1), where there is a large error given the interpolation range. The extrapolation range has a smaller error, but this is an artifact of their evaluation method where they normalize with a random baseline. Since a random baseline with have a higher error for the extrapolation range, a similar error will appear to be smaller. A correct solution to division should have both a small interpolation and extrapolation error.
    \item $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ and NALU are barely able to learn $\sqrt{z}$, with just 2\% success-rate for NALU and 7\% success-rate for $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$.
    \item NMU is fully capable of learning $z^2$. It learn this by learning the same subset twice in the NAU layer, this is also how $\mathrm{NAC}_{\bullet}$ learn $z^2$.
\end{enumerate}
